Advent of Code 2022 in Python and Kotlin.

# Inputs

Inputs are stored in `input/input<day>` and `input/input<day>-sample`.

# Run

- `cargo run -- <day>` to run a single day and print the results to stdout.
- `cargo run -- 0` to run all days and to verify the outputs are correct.
- Add any extra parameter to run in sample mode. 

There is one solver per day, in `solver<day>.rs`.

The solutions to part one and part two are output to stdout.
